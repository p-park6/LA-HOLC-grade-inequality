# HOLC Grade Inequality in Los Angeles

This repository covers the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) that was created in the 1930s'. This was a project under the New Deal that President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed. While originally intended to help assess the risk of lending to certain households, it was instead fueled by racial discrimination by rating white neighborhoods a higher grade while rating minority neighborhoods a lower grade.

## What this notebook covers
-  Creating maps from the `tmap` package
-  Analysis of the dataset by finding percentages and amounts
-  Creating a bar graph to visualize results


## Note on reading in the data
Since the dataset is quite large to be pushed to Github, it is **highly recommended** to:

1. Download the data first
2. Upload it in the .rproj you are working in
3. Put the data file in the .gitignore file.

Data can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lcazRbNSmP8Vj9sH1AIJcO4D1d_ulJij/view?usp=share_link)
