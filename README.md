# HOLC Grade Inequality in Los Angeles

This repository covers the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) that was created in the 1930s'. This was a project under the New Deal that President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed. While originally intended to help assess the risk of lending to certain households, it was instead fueled by racial discrimination by rating white neighborhoods a higher grade while rating minority neighborhoods a lower grade.
